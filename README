Chrome extension to enable seamless launching of ClickOnce applications.
Based on https://code.google.com/p/clickonceforchrome/

A sample that detects .net framework version and presence of ClickOnce support, as well as launching the extension installer, for both IE, Chrome and Firefox is in the sample dir

CHANGELOG:
	1.1.0 
		- added clrVersion property to the embed object that contains all the .net framework versions in the same format as X-ClickOnceSupport
